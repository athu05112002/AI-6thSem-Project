AI virtual mouse and desktop voice assistant 

The AI Virtual Mouse project is a revolutionary hands-free computer interaction solution that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technology. By leveraging the Mediapipe library, this project tracks and interprets hand movements through computer vision algorithms. It enables users to control the computer and interact with applications without the need for a physical mouse or touchpad. This innovative approach enhances accessibility and provides a natural interface for individuals with limited mobility or physical disabilities.
